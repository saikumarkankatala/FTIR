# Microplastic Pollution Study Using ATR-FTIR and Machine Learning

## Introduction
In recent years, microplastic (MP) pollution has emerged as a significant environmental concern worldwide. This study proposes the utilization of Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) data combined with advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to aid in the identification and classification of MP particles.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this study are:
- To explore the transition from a basic 1D Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to more sophisticated 1D-adapted Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, namely AlexNet and VGGNet.
- To train and evaluate these models on a dataset comprising ATR-FTIR spectra of different types of microplastics.
- To provide accurate and efficient MP classification tools to aid in environmental research efforts.
